                        <p>The first bedroom here, designed by Mauritz Snyman, uses soft and soothing grays and silvers to create a sparkling, luxurious feel. From a modern chandelier that dangles over the bed to a plush silvery gray carpet that practically begs for your bare feet, waking up in this bedroom would be like waking up inside a warm storm cloud.</p>
                        <p>While having more money might seem like a one way ticket to all the happiness you could handle, it doesnâ€™t hurt to bring in some cheerful colors, too. This sharp sunny bedroom has plenty of that with splashes of citrus and lots of light.</p>
                        <p class = "rate">
                            <span>Rs.9990.00 /</span> Per Night

                        <p>Of course, sometimes a stripped down design is what luxury is all about. This sleek and minimalist bedroom still speaks to luxury but it does so in a whisper. From simple white gauze curtains to a long and low bed there is nothing here that isnt necessary. Except maybe the chandelier.</p>

                        <p>On the other end of the spectrum is this simple bedroom that celebrates luxury in an entirely different way. With dark wood accents and a carefully organized storage system, this bedroom is what modern luxury is all about.</p>
                        <p>The luxury features dont stop in this bedroom. Mounting the elevated bed platform is like climbing into a throne while an elegant, ornate vanity is also fit for royalty. The huge private bath is the only way to soak away a long day of luxury living.</p>

                        <p>The staff were amazing. I somehow lost my immigration card between the airport and the hotel. The staff helped me resolve this matter which took hours over a number of days of visiting police and government offices. Ilya P in particular went way above and beyond to help me out and was an absolute gentleman to deal with. I can't praise the staff of penta hotel enough. They are what makes penta special relative to all the other hotels in Delhi (most of which I have stayed at)
                            Besides the staff the food was great. We had multiple meals at the bar. All were really good. The atmosphere in the bar was consistently nice.</p>

                        <h3>Comfortable Living</h3>
                        <p>Wonderful place to stay. I dont normally stay in hotels but this was perfect â€“ the beds are comfortable, and the rooms are quiet despite the fact that if you want to, you can spend time outside with other travelers and the staff.I had a great time meeting everyone and socializing yet when I wanted to, I could get a quiet nightâ€™s sleep.</p>

                        <p> stayed at [Hotel Modern] for three nights in November 2019. What an amazing hotel. I was greeted with such kindness and this continued throughout my stay. I booked the king room and my room was situated on the 14th floor. The room was fantastic. Clean, modern, and had a fantastic view over Karnataka. The rooms were big for  standards. I canâ€™t complain about this hotel. The gym was great, the rooftop bar was fantastic, and all of the facilities were clean and modern. The restaurant located inside the hotel. Food was delicious. I dined here for breakfast and dinner.</p>
